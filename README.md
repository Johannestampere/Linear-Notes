In my first linear algebra course at Waterloo (MATH 136), a problem I often encountered in lectures was not understanding the content geometrically. The textbook was of little to no help, containing only a couple of 2D/3D graphs, which were hard to understand since they were on paper. 

That's why I'm making a note-taking app for math students, more specifically linalg students, to take notes while having the ability to see what you're actually learning in interactive 3D graphs. The app also supports LaTeX.
